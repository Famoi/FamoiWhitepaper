**Abstract.** This paper discusses Famoi. Famoi is an autonomous asset management and supply chain network infrastructure. Filling the gap within a decentralised supply chain eco-system. Allowing an asset or product to have its provenance immutably recorded, certified or tracked. Autonomously having payments settled or collected with/from suppliers. To create greater trust and genuine reputation between all parties in a transaction. With core provenance details available to end-users on the consumer side before purchasing a product. Creating a more transparent buying experience. Solving the problem of the ever growing trade of counterfeit or stolen goods that are sold. Allowing buyers to learn more about the product that they are buying and genuinely know that it is authentic.The paper conclude with a selection of use cases.
