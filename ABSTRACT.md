**Abstract.** This paper discusses Famoi. Famoi is an autonomous asset management and supply chain network infrastructure. Filling the gap within a decentralised supply chain eco-system. Allowing an asset or product to have its provenance immutably recorded, certified or tracked. To aid in creating more transparent businesses. Autonomously having payments settled or collected with/from suppliers. To create greater trust and genuine reputation between all parties in a transaction. With core provenance details available to end-users on the consumer side before purchasing a product. Solving the problem of the ever growing trade of counterfeit or stolen goods that are sold. Allowing buyers to learn more about the product that they are buying and genuinely know that it is authentic. Rewarding consumers and businesses through the use of Gamification. Businesses are given certified badges according to the materials or ingredients used within their products. Positive for the sustainable, ethical, recyclable or healthy. Negative if not. This allows the company to build genuine reputation and trust with their consumers. The paper concludes with a selection of use cases.
