**Abstract.** This paper discusses an autonomous asset management and supply chain network infrastructure. That allows an asset or products provenance to be immutably recorded, certified or tracked throughout their supply chain's network. Autonomously having payments settled or collected with/from suppliers. To create greater trust and genuine reputation between all parties in a transaction. With core provenance details made available to end-users on the consumer or private client side before purchase. Creating a more transparent buying experience. Solving the problem of the selling of counterfeit or stolen goods. Allowing buyers to learn more about the product that they are buying and genuinely know that it is authentic.
