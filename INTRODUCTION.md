#What is it?
Asset management and  supply chain automation currently requires a third-party to manage your assets or sign-off  and track asset shipment performance.  This we hope to reduce the need for through a platform built for automated asset transactions and certification.  

With the aim being to achievethe development of an Opensource infrastructure that is part of a decentralised autonomous organisation. 

That records and certifies the provenance of an asset both in real time immutably through the supply chain to manually and autonomously recording assets like art, antiquities and jewellery that may contain vast  histories of  owners, valuers, advisors and documentation of exhibitions. 

These require a more secure and permanent way of storing official documents. As well as authenticating the  provenance and the individual proof-of-authenticity and origin of an asset. 

#Your Goal?
Our goal is to record the world's assets on to the Ethereum blockchain. 

Making it easier to prove authenticity and provenance. And reduce costs. Making it easier to track, protect and pay providers in real-time throughout an asset's journey in its supply chains life-cycle.
