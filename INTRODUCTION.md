# Introduction


###What is it

Asset management and  supply chain automation currently requires a third-party to manage your assets or inventories sign-off. Tracking their shipment performance and protecting their authenticity. 

This we hope to reduce the need for through a platform built for automated asset transactions and certification.  

With the aim being to achieve the development of an opensource infrastructure that is part of a decentralised autonomous organisation.  

That records and certifies the provenance of an asset both in real time immutably through the supply chain to manually and autonomously recording assets like art, antiquities and jewellery. That may contain vast  histories of  owners, valuers, advisors and documentation of exhibitions. 

These require a more secure and permanent way of storing official documents. As well as authenticating the  provenance and the individual proof-of-authenticity and origin of an asset. 

###Motivation
Our motivation is to record the world's assets and inventory on to the Ethereum block chain making it easier to prove their authenticity and provenance.

Reducing costs and making it easier to track and protect assets or inventory. As well as paying providers in real-time throughout their journey in the supply chains life-cycle.
