# Introduction


###What is it

Asset management and  supply chain automation currently does not transparently record an asset or inventories provenance. Neither does it autonomously track shipment performance and protect their authenticity.

This we hope to reduce the need for through a platform built for automated asset transactions and certification.  

With the aim being to achieve the development of an opensource infrastructure that is part of a decentralised autonomous organisation.  

That records and certifies the provenance of an asset both in real time immutably through the supply chain to manually and autonomously recording assets like art, antiquities and jewellery. That may contain vast  histories of  owners, valuers, advisors and documentation of exhibitions. 

These require a more secure and permanent way of storing official documents. As well as authenticating the  provenance and the individual proof-of-authenticity and origin of an asset. 

###Our Goal
Our goal is to record the world's assets and inventory on to the Ethereum block chain making it easier to prove their authenticity and provenance.

Reducing costs and making it easier to track and protect assets or inventory. As well as paying providers in real-time throughout their journey in the supply chains life-cycle.

###Motivation
Industrial revolution 4.0 and the ever growing Internet of Things space is certainly one key motivator behind Famoi.

Enterprise systems that can be easily harnessed and integrated into existing legacy systems. Which must allow these enterprises to seamlessly transition and evolve into the distributed and decentralised market. 

Which will also allow for these enterprises to have greater speed, accuracy and security. As well as systems that allow customers to gain greater end-user transparency with the products that they purchase either through a supermarket or private art dealer.
