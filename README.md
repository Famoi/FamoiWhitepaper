**Abstract.** This paper describes standardising a method for recording and certifying an asset or inventory and its provenance onto the Ethereum block chain ledger and database. Using typical timestamping protocols currently used on the ledger that may link an asset or inventories information (i.e. Documents, Images or Videos) to an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). A distributed storage system that acts as a vault with an owner-set lifespan of 120 days or forever in accessibility. Before deletion. This information within storage is strictly accessible by permissioned users only. The primary accessible permission being the owner of the asset or inventory. Asset or inventory transactions are automated by Smart Contracts. Computer programs that self-execute a set of rules. And are linked to all parties involved in a transaction. Throughout an asset or inventories journey in the supply chain. Including the assets network of provenance relationships. Assets that are recorded, sold, loaned or tracked through a supply chain receive block chain certificates. Legally certifying the transaction occurred at a particular time. Which may then be searched and audited transparently. With core provenance details being available to end-users on the consumer and private client side.
