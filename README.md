**Abstract.** The paper describes standardising a method of recording and certifying assets or inventory. Linking them to their provenance. Onto the Ethereum block chain ledger and database. Using typical time-stamping protocols used by the ledger. Linking asset or inventory information (i.e. Documents, images or videos) to an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). A distributed storage system. That within Famoi's setup will act as a secure document storage vault. With an owner-set lifespan of 120 days or forever in accessibility. Before deletion. This information within storage is strictly accessible by permissioned users only. The primary accessible permission being the owner of the asset or inventory. Asset or inventory transactions are automated using Smart Contracts. Computer programs that self-execute a set of rules. And are linked to all parties involved in a transaction. Throughout an asset or inventories journey in the supply chain. Including the assets network of provenance relationships. Assets receive a block chain certificate when recorded, sold, loaned or tracked through their supply chain. Legally certifying the transaction occurred at a particular time or proving an asset is authentic. Not a counterfeit or stolen. Proof of ownership or authenticity may be searched and audited transparently within the public domain. With core provenance details available to end-users on the consumer or private client side. Before purchasing. With the provenance details being available through a cross-platform of devices.
