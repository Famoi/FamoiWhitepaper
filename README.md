# Famoi Whitepaper 


### ## **Famoi:** A decentralised platform for recording and certifying asset or inventory provenance

**Abstract.** This paper describes standardising a method for recording and certifying an asset and its provenance onto the Ethereum Block chain ledger and database. Using typical timestamping protocols currently used on the block chains ledger that may link an assets information  (i.e. Documents, Images or Videos)  to a distributed storage system that acts as a vault with a owner-set lifespan of 120 days to forever in accessibility before deletion. This information within storage is strictly accessible by permissioned users only. The primary accessible permission being the owner of the asset. Asset transactions are automated by Smart Contracts. Computer programs that self-execute a set of rules that may be linked to all parties involved in a transaction. Including the assets network of provenance relationships. An asset that is successfully recorded or sold, loaned or tracked through a supply chain receives a block chain certificate to legally certify the transaction occurred at a particular time and can be searched and audited transparently.
